# node-red-contrib-august-home
Interface for August Home devices, such as the August Smart Locs, for Node-Red. This node connects to the August API, which appears to be mostly undocumented now. Excellent resources in the links below (from which the bulk of the api calls in this project were derived).

*Still under development.*

Status: Designing and working the basic functionality.
